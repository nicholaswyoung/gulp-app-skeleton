# Gulp App Skeleton

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/nicholaswyoung/gulp-app-skeleton.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

After many trials and refactors, this is the skeleton that we use for all front-end application development at [Original Machine](http://originalmachine.com).

It includes everything you need to begin an application. [Angular](https://angularjs.org) as the framework, [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) for expressive CSS,
and [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks) templates.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io)
installed and configured. Next, run:

```
git clone git://github.com/originalmachine/gulp-app-skeleton.git {{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}}
cd {{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}}
npm install
```

Once that's done, you can run ```gulp``` to build the required front-end files.
Not only will this task setup your application, but it also boots the HTTP and
LiveReload servers, so you're ready to rock.
